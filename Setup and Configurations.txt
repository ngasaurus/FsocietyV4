Setup & Configuration

Before using Fsociety V4, you need to configure the controller GUI to connect to your bot(s).

1. Edit controller_gui.py to set your bot IP address

Open the file controller_gui.py in a text editor like Notepad++ (or any editor you prefer).

Find this line inside the send_command_to_bot function (around line 100):


sock.connect(("0.0.0.0", 9999))  # Replace "0.0.0.0" with your bot machine's IP address

Replace "0.0.0.0" with the actual IP address or hostname of your bot machine.



---

Examples:

Your setup	What to put instead of "0.0.0.0"

Bot and controller on the same machine	"127.0.0.1" or "localhost"
Bot on another machine in your local network (LAN)	"192.168.x.x" (replace with your bot machineâ€™s LAN IP)
Bot on a remote server or VPS	"your.remote.server.ip"
